Shipping Cost Calculator Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program calculates the shipping cost of a package based on its weight and distance.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input the weight of the package and distance for shipping
- Checks if the distance is within the acceptable range (10-3000 miles)
- Calculates the shipping cost based on the weight and distance using predefined rates
- Displays the shipping cost

Features:

- User input for package weight and shipping distance
- Conditional statements for distance and weight validation
- Predefined shipping rates based on weight categories
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./shipping_cost_calculator
    - On Windows: shipping_cost_calculator.exe
4. Enter the package weight and shipping distance when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using conditional statements for decision-making
- Working with floating-point variables and arithmetic operators
- Basic shipping cost calculation logic
